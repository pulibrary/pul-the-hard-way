## File System Locks

Occasionally servers will be locked down and we will need to kick them with a hard reboot. 

The following steps will need a VPN connection

* Using your preferred RDP Client ([Microsoft ships a good one](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-mac)) connect to `lib-staff998` -You will be prompted for you Active Directory netid and password.
* On the resulting Desktop is a shortcut to the VSphere Application - Credentials are on lastpass-
* Find the VM and restart or otherwise correct the mistake.
* Logout - this is a shared machine so this step is also important.
